    "\n",
    "An array is a data structure that can store a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data. It is used to store a collection of data or as a collection of variables of the same type. It requires a specific function from an array module; NumPy package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences between list and array\n",
    "A list is a data structure that's built into Python and holds a collection of items. They are enclosed in square brackets, ordered and mutable. Their elements do not need to be unique and consists of different data types e.g., you can combine strings, integers and objects in the same list. It can’t handle numerical operations and they can’t efficiently store large amount of data. \n",
    "An array is also a data structure that stores a collection of items. Like lists, arrays are ordered, mutable, enclosed in square brackets, and able to store non-unique items. But when it comes to the array's ability to store different data types, you need to import either an array module or a NumPy package. Arrays store data compactly and are great for numerical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "A list and array are similar in that they are an ordered collection of items, can be changed or replaced but arrays can store similar data types and are better at processing many values quickly. while a list can store more than one data type. However, a tuple is an unordered collection of items. The Items in the tuple cannot be changed or replaced.\n"
